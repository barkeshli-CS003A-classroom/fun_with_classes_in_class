The Big 3 Lecture:

Destructor explained.


shows default copy ctor and assignment operator:
bogus(): i: 6,j: 12
enter c1: 17, -5
[0017, -5 ]  [0005, 0 ]
c3: [0017, -5 ], c4: [0017, -5 ]
c5: [0007, 0 ]
c5 after assignment: [0017, -5 ]





Added operators to counter.
the extraction operator is used to explain extracting Rational
object. Will not work for counter.

Problem with 
    //same thing, strange syntax
    // why doesn't this work? 
    //operator<<(operator<<(cout, c4), endl);
in main.cpp. Figure out what happened.
